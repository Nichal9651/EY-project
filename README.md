working on Agent AI

##Introduction

The B2B RFP process in industrial manufacturing is slow, manual, and often inefficient.
 Teams spend long hours searching for opportunities, matching product details, and preparing quotations.
 This manual effort leads to delays, errors, and missed business deals.
 To address this, we propose an AI-driven multi-agent system that automates and streamlines the entire RFP workflow.
 The solution enables faster, more accurate, and data-driven responses, improving efficiency and competitiveness.

##Problem Statement
The current B2B Request for Proposal (RFP) process in industrial manufacturing firms is highly manual, time-consuming, and prone to inefficiencies. Teams spend extensive hours identifying relevant RFPs from multiple portals, matching them with internal product SKUs, preparing quotations, and estimating competitive pricing.This delays response times and often results in missed business opportunities.

To address this, we aim to build an Agentic AI system that automates and optimizes the entire RFP response lifecycle — from RFP discovery to intelligent product matching and price estimation — using a network of collaborative AI agents.

Our solution transforms a reactive manual workflow into a proactive, autonomous, and data-driven process, enabling faster responses, improved accuracy, and enhanced competitiveness in the B2B market.
